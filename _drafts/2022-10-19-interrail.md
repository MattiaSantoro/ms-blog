_My interrail trip._
{: .notice--primary}

Everyone likes traveling and every young adult seeks freedom, that's why I felt so fortunate to have got the opportunity of having this awesome experience.
Interrail is all about a backpack and some points and ideas on a map. You start with expectations and curiosity. You don't know what you'll find but that's exactly what you signed up for.

why going solo
I love people and I consider myself an extrovert person, don't get me wrong. But I feel like is very important in life and in relations between you and others to know yourself, having time and experiences only for you.

My process was really simple. I did my last exam of the summer term on the 6th of September. After some exam-end celebrations with my friends I went home in Italy and looked for destinations and nice places in Europe: a very simple task as we all know the beauty of the old continent. I prepared my travel companion, a 36 liters osprey backpack, it weighted 10 kilos and I'm quite proud of it. I had with me all I needed and I felt like with it I was ready to go anywhere and forever. I also clipped a moon brooch to it, a nice present I received from my sister just before leaving for my adventure.

At 8 am on the 10th of September from my hometown Bolzano I started my journey on my only long distance transportation system for the rest of my trip. I was really hyped. I got with me my kindle for the hours I spent on the train not looking out the window. My book for this trip was "How to build a car" from F1' aerodynamicist Adrian Newey (really good book as I added it to [my favorite books][1]). I was trying to understand in which direction I wanted to develop my carrier in the next years and this book is like gold for any mech or aero engineering student. Another thing I couldn't forget was a journal. I was looking forward to journaling and documenting my trip.
