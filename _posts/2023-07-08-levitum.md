_This short post is here just to express my gratitude for being part of such a cool team of young people wanting to learn and experiment with new cool stuff!_

## What is Levitum?
[Levitum][1] is a team of young people studying at TUM. We want to build the world's longest-range eVTOL Drone. We want to do that by using a hydrogen fuel cell for more range. The goal is to fly 300 km without refueling. We are just quite not there, but we are working hard!

## My time
I'm part of this project since November 2022. I worked in the Preliminary Design Team and I leant a bunch!
I had the opportunity to do manufacturing & prototyping. I used Laser-Cutting machines, 3D printing machines, and even CNC milling machines, for which I created the G-Code. For this, I used Autodesk Fusion 360.
I also did aerodynamics analysis with Python scripts live SUAVE and tools like AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice).

It has been an awesome experience and I am looking forward to the next milestones with my fellow team members!

*Ciao!*
