Hi! I'm an Italian engineering student based in Munich, Germany.<br>
I'm currently doing my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.<br>
I love challenging myself and going down technical rabbit holes.
I'm looking forward to develop new skills in work and life.<br><br>
Other than that I like the outdoors and nature.
