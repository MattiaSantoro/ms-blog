Hi! I'm an Italian engineering student based in Munich, Germany.

I'm currently doing my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.<br>
I love challenging myself and going down technical rabbit holes.

<br>
I'm looking forward to developing new skills in work and life.<br><br>
Other than that, I like the outdoors and nature.
