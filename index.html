<!--# About me-->
Hi, welcome to my website!
I'm an Italian engineering student based in Munich, Germany.
I'm currently doing my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.
I love challenging myself and going down technical rabbit holes.
I'm looking forward to develop new skills in work and life.
Other than that i like the outdoors and nature.
